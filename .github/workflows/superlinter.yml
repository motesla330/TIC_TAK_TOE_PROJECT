    steps:
    - name: Checkout repository
      uses: actions/checkout@v4 # Action to check out your code

    - name: Set up C++ environment (if needed)
      # Example: For a C++ project, you might need specific compilers or tools
      # uses: The tool you want to use
      # run: sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y build-essential

    - name: Compile Authentication.cpp (example)
      run: |
        # Replace with your actual compile command
        # g++ Authentication.cpp -o auth_app
        echo "Compiling Authentication.cpp..."
        # Add your actual compilation commands here.
        # For a more complex project, you'd use your build system (e.g., Make, CMake, Bazel)
        # For example, if you have a Makefile:
        # make all

    - name: Run tests (example)
      run: |
        # Replace with your actual test commands
        # ./auth_app --test
        echo "Running tests for Authentication.cpp..."
        # Add your actual test commands here.
        # For example, if you have a test runner:
        # ./my_tests

    - name: Deploy (example - CD part)
      # This part is highly dependent on your deployment target.
      # You might use an action to deploy to AWS, Azure, GCP, Heroku, etc.
      # Or run custom scripts to deploy.
      # This step will only run if previous steps succeed.
      if: success() && github.ref == 'refs/heads/main' # Only deploy from main branch on success
      run: |
        echo "Deploying..."
        # Add your deployment commands here.
        # For instance, if deploying to an S3 bucket:
        # aws s3 sync . s3://your-bucket-name --delete
        # Or triggering another deployment system
